# xpm — Usage

Complete usage reference for the `xpm` binary, based on `crates/xpm/src/cli.rs`,
`crates/xpm/src/main.rs`, and the project README.

---

## Global flags

These flags are accepted by every subcommand.

| Flag | Short | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------|-------------|
| `--config` | `-c` | `PATH` | Path to the configuration file (default `/etc/xpm.conf`) |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | count | Increase verbosity (`-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`) |
| `--no-confirm` | | | Skip confirmation prompts |
| `--root` | | `PATH` | Alternative installation root directory |
| `--dbpath` | | `PATH` | Alternative database directory |
| `--cachedir` | | `PATH` | Alternative cache directory |
| `--no-color` | | | Disable colored output |

The CLI is defined with `clap` and requires a subcommand (`arg_required_else_help = true`).

## Commands

### `sync` — Synchronize package databases

Alias: `Sy`. Downloads the latest `.db` (and best-effort `.files`) database files from every
configured repository and parses them into local sync databases.

```bash
xpm sync [OPTIONS]
xpm Sy [OPTIONS]
```

| Flag | Short | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--force` | `-f` | Force a full database refresh even if databases look up to date |

Implementation note: `cmd_sync` in `main.rs` runs per-repository sync workers in parallel chunks,
tries each configured mirror with retries, reports which mirror answered, and then parses the
downloaded `.db` / `.files` so the local package count can be shown. Remote sync failures are
warned and do not abort the whole run.

### `install` — Install packages

Alias: `S`. Installs one or more packages by name from the synchronized databases.

```bash
xpm install <PACKAGES>... [OPTIONS]
xpm S <PACKAGES>... [OPTIONS]
```

| Flag | Short | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--download-only` | `-w` | Download packages without installing |
| `--as-deps` | | Mark the package as installed as a dependency |
| `--as-explicit` | | Mark the package as explicitly installed |
| `--no-optional` | | Skip optional dependencies |

Behavior (from `main.rs`): the package is located by exact name across the configured
repositories in order (first repository that provides it wins), downloaded to the cache
directory, checked against a remote `.sig` file according to the effective `sig_level`, and
checked against `sha256sum` when the database entry carries one. The download then becomes an
install operation on a `Transaction`. With `--download-only` the run stops after downloading.
Otherwise xpm asks for confirmation (unless `--no-confirm`) and then prepares and commits the
transaction, which extracts the files and registers the package in the local database.

Note: despite the "Resolving dependencies..." message, the current CLI install path does not run
the SAT resolver; it selects the package by name from the synced database.

### `remove` — Remove packages

Alias: `R`. Removes installed packages, using the file manifest recorded in the local database.

```bash
xpm remove <PACKAGES>... [OPTIONS]
xpm R <PACKAGES>... [OPTIONS]
```

| Flag | Short | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--recursive` | `-s` | Also remove unneeded dependencies |
| `--no-deps` | `-d` | Skip dependency checks |
| `--nosave` | `-n` | Remove configuration files as well (purge) |

The package must be registered in the local database (otherwise xpm reports it is not
installed). Confirmation is requested unless `--no-confirm`.

### `upgrade` — System upgrade

Alias: `Su`. Upgrades all installed packages to the newest available versions.

```bash
xpm upgrade [OPTIONS]
xpm Su [OPTIONS]
```

| Flag | Short | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--force` | | Force reinstallation of up-to-date packages |
| `--ignore` | | Skip specific packages (repeatable, `--ignore <PKG>`) |

`upgrade` always refreshes the databases first (equivalent to `pacman -Syu`), compares installed
versions against the remote latest entries using the ALPM-compatible version comparison, and
plans remove+install operations per package that changed. With no packages installed it reports
"Nothing to do".

### `query` — Query the local database

Alias: `Q`. Lists installed packages from the local database.

```bash
xpm query [FILTER] [OPTIONS]
xpm Q [FILTER] [OPTIONS]
```

| Argument / Flag | Short | Description |
|-----------------|-------|-------------|
| `FILTER` | | Optional package name filter |
| `--explicit` | `-e` | Only explicitly installed packages |
| `--deps` | `-d` | Only packages installed as dependencies |
| `--orphans` | `-t` | Orphan packages (no longer required) |
| `--upgrades` | `-u` | Packages with available updates |

Implementation note: the flags and filter are parsed, but the handler is currently a stub that
only prints the intended filter type.

### `search` — Search packages

Alias: `Ss`. Searches for packages by name, description, or provides.

```bash
xpm search <QUERY> [OPTIONS]
xpm Ss <QUERY> [OPTIONS]
```

| Flag | Short | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--local` | `-l` | Search in the local database instead of the sync databases |

Implementation note: currently a stub.

### `info` — Package information

Alias: `Si`. Displays detailed information about a package.

```bash
xpm info <PACKAGE> [OPTIONS]
xpm Si <PACKAGE> [OPTIONS]
```

| Flag | Short | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--local` | `-l` | Query the local database instead of the sync databases |

Implementation note: currently a stub.

### `files` — List package files

Alias: `Ql`. Lists all files owned by an installed package.

```bash
xpm files <PACKAGE>
xpm Ql <PACKAGE>
```

Implementation note: currently a stub.

### `repo` — Repository management

Manages user-added (temporary) repositories. Predefined repositories come from `/etc/xpm.conf`;
user-added repositories are stored as TOML files under `/etc/xpm.d/`.

```bash
xpm repo list                 # predefined + user-added repositories
xpm repo add <NAME> <URL>     # add a temporary repository
xpm repo remove <NAME>        # remove a user-added repository
```

Examples (from the built-in help):

```bash
xpm repo add chaotic-aur https://cdn-mirror.chaotic.cx/$repo/$arch
xpm repo add my-repo https://username.github.io/my-repo/$arch
xpm repo add local file:///srv/packages/$arch
```

`repo add` refuses to overwrite an existing entry of the same name. After adding a repository,
run `xpm sync` to fetch its database.

### `usage` — Built-in help

Shows detailed usage help for the whole tool or for a topic/command.

```bash
xpm usage                    # general overview
xpm usage commands           # list all commands
xpm usage config             # configuration file format
xpm usage repos              # repository management
xpm usage <command>          # help for a specific command (sync, install, remove, upgrade, ...)
```

`xpm <command> --help` also works through clap.

## Pacman-style aliases

| Alias | Maps to | Pacman equivalent |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `Sy` | `sync` | `pacman -Sy` |
| `S` | `install` | `pacman -S` |
| `R` | `remove` | `pacman -R` |
| `Su` | `upgrade` | `pacman -Su` |
| `Q` | `query` | `pacman -Q` |
| `Ss` | `search` | `pacman -Ss` |
| `Si` | `info` | `pacman -Si` |
| `Ql` | `files` | `pacman -Ql` |

## Typical workflow

```bash
xpm sync                       # refresh package databases
xpm install <package>          # install a package
xpm upgrade                    # upgrade installed packages (syncs first)
xpm query                      # list installed packages
xpm remove <package>           # remove a package
```

Non-interactive use (for scripts) needs `--no-confirm`. For isolated/rootless experiments use
`--config`, `--root`, `--dbpath`, and `--cachedir` to point at temporary directories; when the
installation root is not `/`, xpm enables shell integration and creates command shims in
`~/.local/bin` (with PATH export lines in `~/.bashrc` and `~/.zshrc`).

## Environment variables and exit codes

`RUST_LOG` is honoured through `tracing-subscriber`'s `EnvFilter` to control log verbosity.
`docs/CLI.md` additionally documents `XPM_CONFIG`, `XPM_CACHE_DIR`, and `NO_COLOR`.

`docs/CLI.md` documents an exit-code matrix (0 success, 1 general error, 2 usage error, up to 7
database locked). Note that this matrix is documented intent rather than an enforced contract in
the current code: in practice clap reports usage errors, `anyhow` reports runtime failures, and
other documented codes are not yet emitted by `main.rs`. Verify against the code before relying
on a specific code.
